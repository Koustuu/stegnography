# QR Code Steganography


## Introduction

This project explores steganography using QR codes, allowing users to hide secret messages within QR codes while maintaining their scannability. By subtly modifying the QR code's error correction level and pixel patterns, we can encode additional information without affecting its readability.


## Features

Hide and extract secret messages from QR codes

Maintain scannability while embedding data

Adjustable error correction and encoding techniques

Python-based implementation with OpenCV and other relevant libraries

This project is useful for secure communication, watermarking, and covert data transmission in a visually inconspicuous way.
